-------- Pipeline Registers --------
IF: used for the fething of the instructions
ID: used for the decoding of the instructions
EX: used for the execution stage to the memory
MWB: used for the memory stage to the write back stage 
-------- Contribiution Behrad --------
Our approach for completing the second assignment was to split the different parts, begin working on them together and then divide and conquer the remaining parts of the remaining tasks. 
We started by working on all the header files after which I worked on instruction decoder and formatter. 
Dylan started working on the ALU operations where we worked together on the stages, this was the bulk of the work, and finished by testing everything and optimizing for memory operations. 
The report is written by both Dylan and I. I personally feel the teamwork was fair as always when working with Dylan.
-------- Contribution Dylan --------
Working with Behrad was a treat and a half. Unfortunatly, even by combining our knowledge, we were unable to finish the Emulator. 
However, I feel like both Behrad and I put as much effort as each other despite having little to show for it.
-------- Note from Behrad and Dylan --------
We spent a lot of time reading the material and trying to complete the simulator, Unfortunatly we both had problems understanding the semantics and have opted to retry the assignment and finish this at a later date
